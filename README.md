# MyPopulationCounter

Included in this repository is the Visual Studio solution for the project. I've placed the program's .exe file named "BirthYears.exe" in the root of the repository, as well as a data file and chart for one of my own test runs.

# How to Run
There are two ways to run the program:
1) Simply double click the .exe
2) Execute the .exe from the command line

If you run from the command line, you can give the program your own data file
ex: "BirthYears mydata.txt"

When the program is executed, it will also generate a chart so you can see the population across all of the years. All files that the program generates (data file and chart) will be located where BirthYear.exe is ran from.

#Data Format
The data format used is just a simple text file. Each line represents a 'Person'. Each line contains 2 numbers seperated by a space. The first number is the year of birth of the person, and the second is their year of death.
